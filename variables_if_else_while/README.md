# TASKS


### 0. POSITIVE ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NEGATIVE NOTHING](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

  - [You can find the source code here](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/c70eE2D1JbdTtyuhDsuYzQ)

  - The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program

  - You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
 
  - The output of the program should be:

    - The number, followed by
          
      - if the number is greater than 0: is positive

      - if the number is 0: is zero
     
      - if the number is less than 0: is negative

  - Followed by a new line

---------------------------------

### [1. THE LAST DIGIT](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c)

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

  - [You can find the source code here](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/tixh4GPxzFzXN1VdXQYt5A)

  - The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program

  - You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. 

Please do not touch this code

  - The output of the program should be:

    - The string Last digit of, followed by

    - n, followed by

    - the string is, followed by

      - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5

      - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0

      - if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

  - followed by a new line
