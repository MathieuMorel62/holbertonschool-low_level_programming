C - Functions, nested loops

0. _PUTCHAR:

    Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

    ==> The program should return 0



1. I SOMETIMES SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA. AND WHEN I CAN'T FALL ASLEEP, I PLAY WHAT I CALL THE ALPHABET GAME:

    Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    ==> Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
    ==> You can only use _putchar twice in your code
